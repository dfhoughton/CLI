dfh.cli
=======

A small project to facilitate writing CLI programs in Java. The aim
is to provide a terse, declarative means of specifying commands, constraints
among commands, usage information, and so forth such that a particular CLI
program isn't cluttered with the argument parsing code and you can easily find
the logic of the program itself. Also, you needn't spend much time writing
the parsing code, you just type a terse *declaration* of how it is to occur and
get on with things.

As of now this is a placeholder for features.
